# Staff of Snakes

A magical staff that has the power to transform into a snake, on command.

- **Divine magic:** Usable by divine spell casters only.
- **In melee:** Treated as a staff with a +1 magic bonus to attacks and damage.
- **On a successful hit:** Upon a human-sized (or smaller) creature, the wielder of the staff may speak the command word, causing it to transform into a serpent and coil around the victim.
- **Victims:** Must **save versus spells** or be immobilised in the coils of the snake. Victims are completely helpless while held by the snake (1d4 turns, or released as the wielder of the staff commands).
- **Snake:** Has AC 5 [14], HD 3 (20hp), and a movement rate of 60’ (20’).
- **When the victim is released:** The snake returns to the owner and transforms back into a staff. (At this point, it is healed of any damage it has suffered.)
- **If the snake is killed:** It does not return to its staff form, becoming non-magical.
- **No charges:** Does not use charges; may be used any number of times.
